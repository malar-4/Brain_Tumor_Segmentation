# Brain_Tumor_Segmentation
🧠 Brain Tumor Segmentation using Computer Vision
This project is a deep learning-based brain tumor classification system using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). It classifies MRI brain scan images into four categories: glioma, meningioma, pituitary, and no tumor. A simple Gradio interface is also provided for real-time predictions.

🔍 Project Overview
Brain tumor detection is crucial for early diagnosis and treatment planning. This project aims to automate the classification process using a CNN trained on MRI scans. The goal is to assist radiologists and healthcare professionals in identifying brain tumor types with high accuracy.
